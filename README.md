# Calculator GUI

## Overview
This is a simple Calculator GUI application built using Python's `tkinter` library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure where functionality is divided into modules for easy maintenance and further development. Additionally, a test suite is provided to ensure the correctness of the calculator functions.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- **Modular Design**: Each component is separated into modules for better organization.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using `tkinter` for a simple and interactive user experience.
- **Test Suite**: Includes unit tests for all arithmetic functions to ensure accuracy.
